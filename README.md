It is my folder to store small projects which are not worth creating separate repo. Some of them are more significant than the other, I will try to list them below:

- LSTM - folder with LSTM for thesis purposes
- GTESTPROJ - Simple project in cmake with gtest included
- DYNAMICLIB - I was testing creation of lib project and exe project on top of that, for purposes of dynamic work with my team
