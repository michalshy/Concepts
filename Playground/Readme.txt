This is my playground to test out C++ features and learning by practice.

Also i wanted to note that this is not a repo for any kind of tutorial for anyone, I do like to take my notes by practice, and i like to follow courses on topics i do not fully understand.
That is why i created this repo, it might help someone, but it does not have to. It is mostly to clarify concept for ME.
